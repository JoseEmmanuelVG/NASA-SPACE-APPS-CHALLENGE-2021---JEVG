##  					**CHALLENGE** : IDENTIFYING RISK WITH SCIENCE + COMMUNITIES

### GENERAL OBJECTIVE
Create prototypes and methodologies to incorporate Earth observations (as satellite data) with local open data provided by national entities and scientific institutes. 
### SECUNDARY OBJECTIVES
Additionally, participants are encouraged to include the information that the general public can contribute by capturing data in their territories to improve the precision of the analysis. 
Finally, any tool or prototype that meets the overall objective of this challenge must potentially be implemented and executed at a low cost by local governments.
### Introduction / Theoretical framework
We can define a landslide as the downward movement of mass (through a process of gravitational fall), in this sense there is primarily the descent of earthy materials such as rock, soil or debris. Said landslide is nothing more than the failure of a slope that leads to a variety of movements in the ground, including rock falls and debris flows.
#### ClassificationClassification
Falls or landslides. They are gravitational processes (practically free fall), originated in large slopes or cliffs, where there is a sudden movement of soils and / or isolated fragments of rocks.
Glide. Downhill mass movements, mainly of earth materials, on one or more fault surfaces delimited by a stable mass of a slope (that or that belonging to or relative to the side), the term slope is often used to name slopes of mountains or of a overall height.
Flow. Those movements of the soils and / or rock fragments sloping down a slope, with relative movements within the mass in which the particles (grains or fragments) move. This type of gliding can be very fast or slow, as well as dry or wet.
#### Factors causing a landslide
 “The general stability of a slope depends on internal and external factors and its analysis is carried out from the definition of the acting forces and the resisting forces. "
Terzaghi (1950)


 In this way, we have the following conditions:
 
o	**Discontinuities**. Interruptions or amorphous conditions to the surface.
o	**Lithology**. Part of geology that studies rocks (physiological factors to these).
o	**Hydrogeology**. Part of geology that deals with the study of fresh water, and in particular underground, and its use. Factors that moisten the area.
o	**Weathering**. Also known as weathering, it is the physical and chemical alteration of rocky materials exposed to the “bad weather” (In the open sky, without a roof or any other repair.).
o	**Pending**. Incline, slope or slope of the terrain.
o	**Land use**. Human interventions that break the natural order of biodiversity, in this case of the surface (modifications or adaptations of the soil.).

That with the help of triggers (external that cause instability), it contributes to causing a landslide. Having the following:

•	**Precipitation**. Rains or water leaks that increase the humidity of the environment.
•	**Earthquakes**. Also known as an earthquake, it is a shaking of the earth's crust.
•	**Volcanic activity.** Any volcanic change that affects the risk zone (explosions that cause earthquakes, ash and gases that change the temperature, etc.).
•	**Human activity**. Soil overload, deforestation, cutting or extraction of land.

### DelimitationDelimitation
America is a continent very prone to having a landslide, taking data from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in the United States alone, these landslides cause between 25 and 50 deaths each year. One more precedent of the danger of these natural disasters in America informs us the United Nations (UN), warning that Latin America and the Caribbean are the second most prone to natural disasters in the world.
In this sense, since 2000, the Latin American region has had an average of 152 million people affected by natural disasters (which directly and indirectly cause landslides); Thus, since the 2000s there have been an approximate 3,000 deaths caused by 66 recorded landslides. Being one of the most recent, the Chiquihuite hill landslide, located in the conurbation municipality of Tlanepantla, Mexico. Reason why, there will be a greater research focus on this event.

### Proposed solutions

#### Using satellite visualization means
###### Probabilistic method for forecasting future landslides, use of WORLDVIEW and artificial intelligence.
Azure Real Time Analytics on Big Data Architecture or Azure Stream Analytics is used, where the data that WORLDVIEW gives us will be obtained, such as humidity, volcanic activity, temperature and those triggers of the area to be studied. All these data can be obtained through the EARTHDATA SEARCH.
An example of the case of Cerro Chiquihuite, a day before the landslide, the conditions and climatological factors were favorable to produce a landslide:

One day later, when the collapse occurs, the energy begins to dissipate after having been released.
